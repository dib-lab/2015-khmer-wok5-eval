Summary information
-------------------

This is the README for the github repository
https://github.com/dib-lab/2015-khmer-wok4-multimap.

This repository contains the pipeline underlying the blog
post/micropub entitled `Labeling a sparse covering of a De Bruijn
graph, and utility thereof
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-wok-labelhash.html>`__.

Contact: C. Titus Brown, titus@idyll.org, or @ctitusbrown (on Twitter).

Running the pipeline
--------------------

We provide two ways to reproduce the results in the blog post -- first,
instructions for a blank Ubuntu virtual machine, and second, 
instructions for running inside a Docker container.

You will need less than 2 GB of RAM and about 10 GB of free disk space to
run all of this.  It should take about 15 minutes to run.

To regenerate the figures in the blog post, see `the Jupyter notebook
'figures.ipynb'
<https://github.com/dib-lab/2015-khmer-wok4-multimap/blob/master/figures.ipynb>`__
in the repository.

Using an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boot up an empty Ubuntu image (an Amazon m3.large should be enough),
and run::

   sudo apt-get update && \
       sudo apt-get -y install python-virtualenv python-dev git bowtie2 \
            samtools libboost-dev zlib1g-dev && \
       sudo shutdown -r now

Log back in, and set yourself up with a virtualenv::

   python -m virtualenv work
   . work/bin/activate
   pip install -U setuptools
   git clone https://github.com/dib-lab/nullgraph.git

Now install the `2015-wok
<https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/tree/2015-wok>`__ branch of khmer::

   git clone https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer.git -b 2015-wok
   cd khmer && make install; cd ..

Go to a sizeable working directory that you have permissions to write
to; on AWS, this is /mnt. ::

   sudo chmod a+rwxt /mnt
   cd /mnt

Then, clone the pipeline::

   git clone https://github.com/dib-lab/2015-khmer-wok4-multimap.git wok4

and grab the data::

   cd wok4
   ./download-data.sh

And, finally, run the pipeline::

   make KHMER=/home/ubuntu/khmer NULLGRAPH=/home/ubuntu/nullgraph

To interpret the results, please see the blog post above, or look through
the Makefile.

Running inside Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**First,** if you need to install Docker, perhaps on your empty Ubuntu
machine from above, do the following::

   wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sudo sh

If you are doing the above on a blank Ubuntu machine on e.g. AWS, make
sure to give the ubuntu user permissions to run docker::

   sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

and then log out & back in to enable those permissions.

Go to a sizeable working directory that you have permissions to write
to; on AWS, this is /mnt. ::

   sudo chmod a+rwxt /mnt
   cd /mnt

Then, clone the pipeline::

   git clone https://github.com/dib-lab/2015-khmer-wok4-multimap.git wok4

and grab the data::

   cd wok4
   ./download-data.sh

And, finally, run the pipeline::

   docker run -v /mnt/wok4:/pipeline titus/2015-wok

To interpret the results, please see the blog post above, or look through
the Makefile.
